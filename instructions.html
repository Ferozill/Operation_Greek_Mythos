      <h1>Instructions on How To Play <em>Operation: Greek Mythos</em></h1>
      <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place each ailment in the matching space on the gameboard.</li>
        <li>Place the tweezers where all players can reach them.</li>
        <li>Shuffle the ailment cards and place them in a deck, facedown, where all players can reach them.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Let's Play</h3>
      <p>The youngest player goes first. Play moves to the left. If you are the first player, take the top card of the deck, and flip it over. This is the ailment you must try to remove from the gameboard. Use the tweezers to remove the ailment without touching the metal sides.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>DON'T ANGER THE MINOTAUR</h4>
    <p>
      If you touch the metal sides, the minotaur will bellow in pain, and his eyes will light up! If this happens, leave the ailment in its space, and pass the ailment card you drew to the player on your left. It is now that player&#39;s turn, and they will try to remove the same ailment you tried to remove. If that player gets the buzzer, the card is passed to the next player, and so on.
    </p>

      </figure>
      
    <p>Note: if every player fails to remove the same ailment in a round, the last player to make an attempt places that ailment card on the bottom of the deck, and the next player draws a new card.
    </p>
      
      <h4>Scoring</h4>
      <ul>
    <li>On your turn, if you remove the ailment without touching the metal sides, you get to keep the card and the ailment! This counts towards your score! Nice work, doctor!</li>
    <li>Now pass the tweezers to the player on your left, and they may draw the next ailment card.</li>
     </ul>
          
      <h4>Winning the Game</h4>
    <p>The game ends when all of the ailments have been removed from the minotaur. All players then add up their ailment cards. Whoever has the most is the winner!</p>
      
      <h4>Solo Play</h4>
    <p>Practice your surgeon skills! Play as described above, and see how many tries it takes you to collect all of the ailments!</p>
